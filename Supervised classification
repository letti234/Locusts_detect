///Step 1: Call on Landsat NDVI and exact sightings data subset to ETH



//  Step 2: Build a composite NDVI where each grid-cell represents the NDVI of 
//  the grid-cell one month before the sighting date



//  Step 3: Build a composite NDVI where each grid-cell represents the NDVI of
//  the grid-cell the month after the sighting date


//  Step 3: compare differences in NDVI's and eliminate cases where they do not change


// Step 4: Select a training sample 



// Step 5: Use the post-exposure composite to train the algorithm to identify the spectral signatures
// of locust-affected areas



// Step 6: Predict locust-affected areas and perform reliability checks with remaining data
